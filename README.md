- [Get a doctor by id](#Get-a-doctor-by-id)

- [Update a doctor data](#Update-a-doctor-data)

#### Get all doctors

You've to request a GET method to this URL

```bash
  http://localhost:8080/medico
```

Currently this url accepts query params, those params are:

- sort=conditionToSort
- offset
- size
- totalPages
- totalElements

This is an example of the use of query parameters for the url get:

```bash
  http://localhost:8080/medico?size=2&sort=name
```

#### Get a doctor by id

```bash
  http://localhost:8080/medico/ID
```


#### Create a doctor

First of all, this is the json to create a doctor

```json
{
    "name": "Erick Cardenas",
    "email": "Erick.Cardenas@voll.med",
    "document": "615342",
    "telephone": "345123435",
    "specialty": "CARDIOLOGIST",
    "dataDirection": {
        "state": "State 2",
        "city": "City 2",
        "number": 2,
        "complement": "b",
        "street": "Cl 13 45"
    } 
}
```

#### Update a doctor data

You must pass the id of the doctor u wanna update through the json, and the data you're gonna change. *U can only change the values: email, telephone, address.*

```json
  {
  "id": 1,
  "email": "email@voll.med",
  "telephone": "345123435",
  "dataDirection": {
    "state": "New state",
